# Crisis Cleanup - AWS Connect

Crisis Cleanup is a collaboratative disaster relief platform that connects relief organization volunteers with people who need help. The Crisis Cleanup platform has been used to connected 631,620 volunteers from 1,919 organizations with 128,080 households in 55 states/provinces and 157 disasters in 7 countries; a new disaster every two weeks.

Crisis Cleanup works best in a collaborative environment where multiple voluntary organizations and agencies work together and coordinate efforts. Because these organizations do not take orders from one another, Crisis Cleanup is designed to facilitate Collaborative Accountability models of inter-agency interaction, rather than command-and-control operations, or or heirarchical accountability models of interaction.
